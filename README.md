# word-guess
This game is like Hangman. It has a finite list of words with corresponding clues.  Each word represents a game. 

For each game:
(1) Given a clue and blanks that represent each character of a word, guess letters that spell the word by pressing letter keys.
(2) If you guess the word before making six mistakes, you win.
(3) If more games are won than lost, you win the match.

NOTE: The number of words this program can handle is arbitrary. This program has a short list for demo purposes.
