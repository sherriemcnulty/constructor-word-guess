# word-guess
This game is like Hangman. It has a finite list of words with corresponding clues. The list is short for testing purposes.

For each word:
(1) Given a clue and blanks that represent each character of a word, guess letters that spell the word by pressing letter keys.
(2) If you guess the word before making six mistakes, you win.

NOTE: The number of words this program can handle is arbitrary. This program has a short list for demo purposes.
